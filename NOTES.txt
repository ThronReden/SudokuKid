DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

30/10/2025 - Naked Sinlges:
    Need to comment isFilled() method in Cell and naked singles method
    in sudoku is VERY unfinished still. This changes werent traked with git. 

05/11/2025 - Naked Sinlges, getSqr() & getPosInSqr():
    Added this two new methods that encapsulate the formulas that get us the
    square a Cell in a given row and column belongs to and it's position in
    its square (also given its row and column) respectively.
    
    + Added commentary to both new methods.
    
07/11/2025 - Naked Singles, NumPlausibleValues(), getPlausVal(n), etc:
    + Added NumPlausibleValues() method in Cell that gets us the number of
    values that could go in it.
    + Added getPlausVal(n) method in Cell that gets us the value of the "n"th
    digit that could fill it.
    + Added getPlausVal() overloaded method in Cell that gets us the value of
    the lowest digit that could fill it.
    * Now Naked Singles method loops through ROWS instead of squares.
    + Added numPlausCells(val) method in CellGroup thatt gets us the number of
    Cells in that group that could be filled with a given digit.
    + Naked Singles method COMPLETED.
    
11/11/2025 - Naked Singles & Sudoku toString():
    + Added a method to Sudoku that returns a representative String for that
    instance of Sudoku.
    * Fixed NakedSingles method failing cause we where counting filled Cells
    as plausible for containing digits when cheking if a Cell was the only
    one of a group that could contain a certain digit.
    * Fixed NakedSingles method still cheking if the square was full instead
    of the row, creating isues as not looping though the full Sudoku.
    + Added to NakedSingles method some testing souts, commented but ready to
    un-comment and use if needed.
    
20/11/2025 - Format, commentary & fixes:
    * Fixed tabulation format of brackets oppening methods.
    * Fixed a commentary format error in a method block divider in Sudoku.
    * Fixed toString() method in Sudoku returning an incorrect bracket pattern.
    + Added extended commentary to mentioned toString() method.
    + Added commentary to nakedSingles() method in Sudoku w/ example sudoku
    matrixs, some the method can and some it cannot fully solve.
    % Discovered an error w/ solveNakedSingles(), don't know what it is!! :(
    
21/11/2025 - Naked Singles is fixed!! and other usefull stuff:
    % Found the error: a break statement was missing to stop one of the
    nested fors once a cell was solved and it was causing a digit to be
    filled on top of the one we had just filled into the cell (and lots of
    chaos w/ update methods and information coherence created because of this).
    + Added showSudoku() method in Sudoku: it prints a visual representation
    of the sudoku on the terminal.
    * Small changes to getSqr() and getPosInSqr() for clarity, no
    functionalities added.
    + Added a couple lines of commentary here and there.

24/11/2025 - PROJECT PORTED TO NETBEANS from BlueJ!

27/11/2025 - Changes to format and commentary added:
    + Added a couple more lines of commentary here and there.
    * Changed a bit the line break format fashion.
    + we are on NetBeans now!

07/01/2026 - Major progress with the NakedPairs method:
    + Added solveNakedPairs() method to Sudoku.
    + Added findNakedPairs() method to CellGroup. It's horrible at the moment.
    + Added numMissingValues() and getMissingValues() methods to CellGroup.
    + Added isPlausible(int val) and removePlausible(int val) methods to
    Cell.

08/01/2026 - Major fixes and design improvements to NakedPairs methods:
    * Changed most of findNakedPairs() method relegating functionalities to
    new methods in CellGroup and Cell:
        + Added getPlausCells, getRestCells, valsExistAlone and
        numCellsOnlyPair methods to CellGroup.
        + Added removeAllPlausibleBut method to Cell.
    * Fixed removePlausible(int val) in Cell and findNakedPairs() in CellGroup
    accounting for filled cells, when it shouldn't.
    * Changed showSudoku() so it prints an empty space instead of a 0 for
    empty cells, this cleans the visual representation a lot.
    * Fixed  error in valsExistAlone method in CellGroup: the boolean value
    was being overwritten (re-asigned w/ "=") instead of added (w/ "|=")
    for every Cell we checked.

    + New feature being developed: Pointing Singles:
        + Added solvePointingSingles method to Sudoku.
        + Added getRow and getCol methods to Sudoku.
        + Added getPlausCellsIndex method to CellGroup.

09/01/2026 - Big big progress and main class:
    + Added new main class to handle execution. It's very lacking rn.
        % Very little user input for now.
        % Missing commentary!
    * Changes to solvePointingSingles method in Sudoku:
        + Added Javadoc.
        * Fixed method returning true for patterns already found before or
        cases in which the pattern found doesn't add information therefore not
        making progress with solving.
        % Missing commentary!
    * Minor fixes to syntax.
    * showSudoku() method is now called showGrid().
    + Added toMatrix method to Sudoku.
    + Added isFilled, isCorrect and isSolved methods to Sudoku.
        % Missing Javadoc & commentary!
    + Added overloaded constructor to Sudoku.
    % There's lack of commentary, should check code from top to bottom and
    comment if needed.
    * Pointin Singles is now Pointing Numbers, as it found both pointing pairs
    and triplets from the begining.
    + New solvePointingPairs & solvePointingTriplets methods in Sudoku that
    asolate those solving methods.
    * solveNakedSingles now is solveAllSingles, as it found both naked singles
    and hidden singles from the begining.
    + New solveNakedSingles & solveHiddenSingles methods in Sudoku to asolate
    those solving methods.

12/01/2026 - General progress (General Progress! )
    + Added some commentary to main method.
    * Minor fixes in main solving loop so it doesn't print the sudoku twice
    when it's solved.
    * All Singles is now Simple Singles.
    * Naked Pairs is now Simple Pairs.
    + New solveNakedPairs & solveHiddenPairs methods in Sudoku to asolate
    those solving methods.
    > New features to work on:
        > Simple Triplets: implementing both Naked and Hidden Triplet patterns.
        > X-Wing: patterns with rows or columns with paralel plausible pairs.
        > Y-Wing: patterns with plausible pairs in three cells that see each
        other affecting a fourth cell.
