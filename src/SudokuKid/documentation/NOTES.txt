DEVELOPMENT NOTES:

30/10/2025 - Naked Sinlges:
    Need to comment isFilled() method in Cell and naked singles method
    in sudoku is VERY unfinished still. This changes werent traked with git. 

05/11/2025 - Naked Sinlges, getSqr() & getPosInSqr():
    Added this two new methods that encapsulate the formulas that get us the
    square a Cell in a given row and column belongs to and it's position in
    its square (also given its row and column) respectively.
    
    + Added commentary to both new methods.
    
07/11/2025 - Naked Singles, NumPlausibleValues(), getPlausVal(n), etc:
    + Added NumPlausibleValues() method in Cell that gets us the number of
    values that could go in it.
    + Added getPlausVal(n) method in Cell that gets us the value of the "n"th
    digit that could fill it.
    + Added getPlausVal() overloaded method in Cell that gets us the value of
    the lowest digit that could fill it.
    * Now Naked Singles method loops through ROWS instead of squares.
    + Added numPlausCells(val) method in CellGroup thatt gets us the number of
    Cells in that group that could be filled with a given digit.
    + Naked Singles method COMPLETED.
    
11/11/2025 - Naked Singles & Sudoku toString():
    + Added a method to Sudoku that returns a representative String for that
    instance of Sudoku.
    * Fixed NakedSingles method failing cause we where counting filled Cells
    as plausible for containing digits when cheking if a Cell was the only
    one of a group that could contain a certain digit.
    * Fixed NakedSingles method still cheking if the square was full instead
    of the row, creating isues as not looping though the full Sudoku.
    + Added to NakedSingles method some testing souts, commented but ready to
    un-comment and use if needed.
    
20/11/2025 - Format, commentary & fixes:
    * Fixed tabulation format of brackets oppening methods.
    * Fixed a commentary format error in a method block divider in Sudoku.
    * Fixed toString() method in Sudoku returning an incorrect bracket pattern.
    + Added extended commentary to mentioned toString() method.
    + Added commentary to nakedSingles() method in Sudoku w/ example sudoku
    matrixs, some the method can and some it cannot fully solve.
    % Discovered an error w/ nakedsingles(), don't know what it is!! :(
    
21/11/2025 - Naked Singles is fixed!! and other usefull stuff:
    % Found the error: a break statement was missing to stop one of the
    nested fors once a cell was solved and it was causing a digit to be
    filled on top of the one we had just filled into the cell (and lots of
    chaos w/ update methods and information coherence created because of this).
    + Added showSudoku() method in Sudoku: it prints a visual representation
    of the sudoku on the terminal.
    * Small changes to getSqr() and getPosInSqr() for clarity, no
    functionalities added.
    + Added a couple lines of commentary here and there.

24/11/2025 - PROJECT PORTED TO NETBEANS from BlueJ!
